The outdoor sensor is a work in progress. The nice to haves are the parts we are still working on however the core functionality. 
We still want a way to measure the battery charge on the battery (100% charge gives a 6 hour run time)

It is made up of 3 total sensors. Currently when everything is attached using the same principle as the Indoor Sensor. Where the cables with 
shared ports will be soldered together into 1 cable to reduce the mess.

Parts:
ESP32 and Breakout board
PMS5003
BME280
SHT41 (Will not have labels please note orientation of board and sensor)
Rechargeable lithium battery
5V Step Up Board
Solar Panel 

Steps:

Create the Power Delivery System
The Step up board will have two terminals B+ and B- solder the positive end of the battery (red) and ground (black) to the respective ports
The micro usb port will be the input for the solar panel to give power for daytime usage
