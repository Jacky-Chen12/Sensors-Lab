# Sensors-Lab


Tabulation of all the steps needed to run the project effectively

There will be a compile error on some computers due to a conflicting file, On older devices the code will work perfectly fine. However, some may experience certain compilation errors.


initial state you need to setup through the auto-connect wifi connection and will fail without wifi or outside the range of the mothership connection
Desired behavior 
If there is no connection it will only check for 6osecs and will drop the connection but still allow us to see the telemetry info 


Bookkeeping of all the indoor equipment we have (need 8 completed kits)

3 completed sensors
1 ESP with breadboard
1 ESP with firmware
5 brand new ESPs
6 new breadboards
1 untested breadboard
8 spare indoor sensors
4 cables to connect the sensor
2 pre-soldered ones questionable
10 scd40 humidity indoor

Bookkeeping of all the outdoor equipment we have

6 Purple humidity sensors bme280
2 Purple temp humidity sensors sht3x 
2 sht3x with unsoldered pinouts
7 sht41 
A strip of sht41
6 beat up blue sensors pms7003 need solderless cables for this as well want standardized cables for clarity
3 new blue sensors
4 blue sensors pms5001 need jst cables that just plug no need to solder


Miselious
3 breakout boards
2 yellow pinout boards


What I did Week 1

Worked towards creating more sensors
Tuesday last years group came in to show us what they worked up to. Including the set up of the brand new kits to connect to the mothership and view the data via the internet
Wednesday collaborated to see what we want to change or add to the functionality
Thursday started building indoor sensors with the parts we already have and keeping tabs on what we are missing so we can order
Friday organized the lab. Took a comprehensive list of all the
